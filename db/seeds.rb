the Mjolnir Mark V/VI DX Two Pack. Now coming to you right out of Halo 5: Guardians is another combo set offering a new internal techsuit body and removable slide/snap on armor pieces. The heavy duty assault armor is three-toned with ghostly white, gray, and black for a super clean look, and orange details and the blue visor really pop. 
The Athlon armor set comes with additional interchangeable parts like hands in different positions, and like the rest of the new Halo ARTFX+ line the internal techsuit body even has limited articulation for posing options! Sculpted by M.I.C., the Spartan Athlon stands nearly 8 1/2 inches tall (1/10th scale) and comes with magnets in his
feet for added stability on his included metal display base. Collect all of the Halo Spartans and Master Chief ARTFX+ statues!", price: 79.00, category_id: figurines.id, size: "8.5in", color: "White", img_url: "https://www.jinx.com/amazonimage/productimage/6089/12/1/1000.jpg")
